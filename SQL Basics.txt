SQL - Search Query Language

Common commands include: Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create, and Drop



Selecting data:
select statement is used to query the database and retrieve selected data matching the specified criteria. An example:

select "column1"
	[, "column2", etc]
	from "tablename"
	[where "condition"];  # where the [] indicates portions which are optional to be included

Can use * to select all columns

the where clause (which is optional) specifies which data to be returned/displayed, using conditionals such as =, >, <, >=, <=, <>, LIKE
note that <> means 'not equal to', and LIKE can parse parts of characters, for example:

select first, last, city
	from info
	where first LIKE 'Er%' #will select any first names that start with Er (% represents an arbitrary character(s))


	
Creating Tables syntax:
create table "tablename"
("column1" "data type",
column2" "data type", ...);

or with constraints:
create table "tablename"
("column1" "data type" [constraint],
"column" "data type" [constraint]...); # where the [] part is optional

You can have as many columns as desired, with optional constraints. Do note that table and column names must start with a letter, and must not
exceed 30 characters in length. Also don't use any SQL reserved keywords as names

Common data types:
	char(size)    # fixed length character string
	varchar(size) # variable length character string
	number(size)
	date
	number(size,d)# number with maximum number of digits "size", and maximum "d" number of decimal digits


	
Inserting into a table syntax:
insert into "tablename"
	(first_column, ..., last_column)
	values(first_value, ..., last_value); #where the column and values match up

Note that strings must be enclosed between single quotes 'string' , and numbers should not have quotes



Updating records syntax:
update "tablename"
	set "columnname" = "newvalue" [, "nextcolumn" = "newvalue2" ...]
	where "columname" OPERATOR "value" [and|or "column" OPERATOR "value"]; #where the [] parts are optional

Examples:
update phone_book
	set area_code = 623
	where prefix = 979;

update phone_book
	set last_name = 'Smith', prefix=555, suffix=9292
	where last_name = 'Jones';

Can verify changes after by using a select statement



Deleting records syntax:
delete from "tablename" where "columnname" OPERATOR "value" [and|or "column" OPERATOR "value"]; # where [] parts are optional

For example removing employees with lastname "May":
delete from employees where lastname = 'May';  # note that if you just put [delete from employees;] everything will be deleted



Drop Table syntax:
drop table "tablename" # is used to delete a table and all rows in the table (removes the table definition in addition to all of its content)
